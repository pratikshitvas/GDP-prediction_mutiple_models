# GDP-prediction_mutiple_models
All must have scene a model to predict the GDP of the countries through various machine learning models so here is a machine learning model to predict the exports and imports of the countries using the GDP values.  

A Machine learning model to predict the EXPORT and IMPORT of the countries using the GDP values over the years.


Algorithm used to perform the prection are:
* Linear regression 
* SVM (support vector machine)
* RBF (radial basis function kernel)
* Regression by Discretization (RD)[trying] 
* Reduced Error Pruning Tree(REP)[trying]
